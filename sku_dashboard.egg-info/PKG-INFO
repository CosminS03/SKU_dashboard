# SKU Portfolio Evaluation Dashboard

## Overview

### Problem Statement
Stock Keeping Units(SKUs) are unique product identifiers used for sales and inventory tracking. Retiring underperforming SKUs helps reallocate resources, free capacity for innovation and align portfolios with consumer trends and brand strategies.
The usual process is slow and rigid: data is filtered by fixed KPI thresholds, reviewed separately by stakeholders and finalized in authority-driven meetings. This approach risks missing true underperformers, duplicates effort and can bias decisions.

### Solution Overview
A dashboard can centralize SKU evaluation, visualizing performance KPIs and using clustering techniques to group SKUs by performance level. This reduces reliance on rigid thresholds and provides a shared, unbiased view for all stakeholders, thus streamlining analysis and decision-making.

### Business Impact
A dashboard can accelerate evaluations, improve portfolio profitability and reduce operational complexity. Organizations using similar approaches have cut evaluation time by up to 75-80% and achieved revenue growth of ~8.6% year-over-year([Georgia Tech Capstone](https://capstone.isye.gatech.edu/research/coca-cola-portfolio-evaluation-process), [MetricsCart](https://metricscart.com/insights/sku-rationalization-in-e-commerce/)).
